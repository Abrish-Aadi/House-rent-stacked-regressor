# House Rent EDA and Price Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset of India and builds a model to predict house prices. The notebook utilizes the dataset available on Kaggle, which includes information about various attributes of houses along with their corresponding prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed on Kaggle using the following link: [House Price Dataset of India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedafsal007/house-price-dataset-of-india). The dataset contains details about the location, size, number of rooms, and other features of houses, as well as their corresponding prices.

## Notebook

The notebook file in this repository, named `House_Rent_EDA_Price_Prediction.ipynb`, contains the code and documentation for performing EDA on the house price dataset and building a model to predict house prices. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Contents

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section focuses on loading the dataset, examining its structure, handling missing values, and performing any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, the dataset is explored through visualizations and statistical summaries to gain insights into the relationships between the house features and prices. Key patterns and trends are identified.

3. Feature Engineering: Here, additional features are created or existing features are transformed to enhance the predictive power of the model. This may include feature encoding, scaling, or creating new derived features.

4. Model Building: In this section, a machine learning model is trained to predict house prices based on the available features. Various regression algorithms may be explored, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or gradient boosting regression.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared, to assess its performance in predicting house prices.

6. Conclusion: The concluding remarks provide a summary of the analysis, highlighting the key findings and insights gained from the EDA process and model's performance.
